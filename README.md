# technology-blog

## Description

I built a tech blog in order for the user to be able to create and post their thoughts, feelings, and opinions anything techology related and be able to comment on other people's post. This can be an easily and more convenient way to ask or answer questions or just share the latest project the user is working on with other people who are interested. Working through this, I learned how to utilize handlebars and adding css and javascript help make the page responsive and to make it more pleasing to the eye.

## Installation

In order to use this code you will need to install Node js. v16 and then in the integrated terminal you will need to type the following:
  - npm i init -y
  - npm i
  - npm i dotenv express mysql2 sequelize
  - npm i bcrypt
  - npm i express-handlebars
  - npm i express-session
  - npm i connect-session-sequelize

You also need to run the sql and seeds files, so to do that you will once again need to go into the integrated terminal, type in mysql -u root -p, enter your password, and source db/schema.sql to run the database. To run the seeds just type in npm run seeds and you are all set to run the code. 

## Usage

When you open the website, you are greeted with the dashboard that's either blank or have posts already made. If you clicked the login button on the top, you have the choice to login or sign up to create an account. Once you have done either of those you can make any comments on a post or go to the dashboard where you can create, modify, or delete your post. When you're done, you can logout of your account until you are ready to go back in.
